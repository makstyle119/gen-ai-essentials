# GenAi Essentials

this is my journey to learn and understand GenAi essentials.

## Questions & Answers

**Q1- What Is AI - (Artificial Intelligence) ?** <br />
**A1-** Machine that perform jobs that mimics human behavior.

this include:
- problem-solving
- decision-making
- understanding natural language
- recognizing speech and images

**Note:** Al's Goal is to interpret, analyze and response to human actions.To simulate human intelligence in machine.

**Q2- What Is ML - (Machine Learning) ?** <br />
**A2-** Machine that get better at a task without explicit programming.

**Q3- What Is DL - (Deep Intelligence) ?** <br />
**A3-** Means a Machine which can perform tasks like human / mimic human behavior.

**Q4- What Is GenAI ?** <br />
**A4- Generative AI** is a specialized subset of AI that generates out comes eg: images, text, audio, video, etc.

It often involves advanced machine learning techniques:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Transformers models eg GPT

**Q5- What Is NLP - (Natural Language Processing) ?** <br />
**A5- NLP - (Natural Language Processing)** is Machine Learning technique that enables computers to process and understand human language.

**Q6- What Is Regression ?** <br />
**A6- Regression** is the process of predicting continuous values. imagine you need to predict the price of a house based on its size and location. Regression is a type of machine learning model that is used to predict continuous values. it will estimate the price of a house based on its size and location by learning patterns from the available data. like price of house in same location will be similar to each other. and also price of house in same size will be similar to each other. with this model, you can predict the price of a house based on its size and location. <br />
there are various algorithms for regression.
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

**Q7- What Is vector and error in regression ?** <br />
**A7-** **vector** is a line that connects two points. **error** is the distance between the actual value and the predicted value.
